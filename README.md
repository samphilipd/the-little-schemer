SCHEME
======

This small project is an implementation of Scheme in JavaScript.

The language primitives are entirely defined in `scheme.js`.

Each chapter corresponds to a chapter in the excellent book "The Little Schemer"
by Friedman and Felleisen.

The goal of these exercises is to learn to think recursively, and become more
familiar with JavaScript syntax at the same time.

Currently there are no JavaScript interpreters that support tail-call optimisation
but this IS a part of EcmaScript 6.

SCHEME relies heavily on (indeed it is pretty much defined by) recursion and
recursive functions. For this reason it is recommended that this code be executed
in an ES6-compatible interpreter if possible.
